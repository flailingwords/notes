Nick's Notes is an accessibility project in the form of brief notes that cover a wide range of topics, but in more neurodivergent friendly/accessible terms. Think Coles/Cliffs Notes, but for neurodivergent and other folks on any topic.

Notes in this collection are intended to be short backgrounds, with concise explanations and examples to provide quick bites of topics that are usually more technical in nature.

Beyond that, as part of the Flailing Words Collective, this site/repository is intended to be maintained by the community. Contributions are encouraged and welcomed!
